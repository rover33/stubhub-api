# Stubhub-api


### Project Description
For this project I want to create a website that pulls from a 3rd party API. 
I will be utilizing the Stub Hub API to pull their list of events. I want to be able to search for events by artist name, or by genre.

### Approach Taken
I started first by getting the API to pull data on Postman. I had to get the API OAuth key working before I could make any calls. Once I was able to access the API I was able to get to take that data and seed it into my file. After I seeded my file I made the routes for evrything followed by creating login info with passport. Lastley I used boostrap to help me position and make the pages look nice.

### Obstacles
I havent had a lot of time to play with bootstrap so that was an obstacle as well as using Axios and other routes. 

### Unsolved Problems
I wanted to get a delete button working on the page and wanted to figure out how to use AXIOS to make ajax type calls.
